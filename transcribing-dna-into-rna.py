# Rosalind ID: RNA
# Notes: RNA (ribose necleic acid) is a nucelotide that "lives alongside" DNA in the chromatim.
#        DNA and RNA have the same structure EXEPT that uracil (U) replaces all thymine (T).
#        DNA is trascribed into messenger RNA (mRNA) by copying each nucelotide, replacing T with U.
